# Welcome to StackEdit!

Hi! This is an app made for CLUBY - the idea behind it, is display the data from the endpoint given, store some additional data and have a good control over the actions, error handling, UI responsiveness etc...

# Keep in mind:
`To run the project in localhost, do not forget to create a .env file where you have to add the env variables, in this case it will be "REACT_APP_API_KEY" and "REACT_APP_URI"`

# Technologies & libraries used:
 - React 
 - React Router 
 - Axios 
 - Formik 
 - Yup (for validation) 
 - Font Awesome
 - React-toastify 
 - Styled Components
